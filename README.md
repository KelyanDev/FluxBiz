FluxBiz is an Android application designed as a practical tool to help users connect with people from around the world. It provides a user-friendly platform for anyone looking to meet and chat with others online, making it easier to connect with peoples.   

With a clean, modern interface, the app is tailored to foster daily discoveries, creating a valuable experience for users in their personal lives.    

    
This project was developed as part of my studies; the similarities with the Twitter application (now called "X") were intentional. Since the expected features for this project were very similar to those of Twitter, I decided to create a user interface that reminds us of our favorite microblogging social network.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Once you install the app for the first time, you'll need to log in using an existing account, or you can register if you don't have one yet. 
After registration, you'll need to verify your email address by clicking on the link sent to your email inbox.   

Once logged in, your feed will be loaded. You will have the option to create and post a Biz, or interact with other users' existing Bizzes. 
You can like, repost, or reply to Bizzes. To check the replies to an existing Biz, simply press on it.

By pressing on a user's profile picture, you'll be able to view their profile and see all the Bizzes they've posted or replied to. 
By pressing your own profile picture (located at the top left of the main activity), you can access your own profile as well as the app's settings.

Lastly, you can modify your account information by navigating to the settings section of the app.
